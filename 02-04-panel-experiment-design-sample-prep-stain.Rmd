*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Cell Loss:** Filtration can result in some loss of cells, especially if the filter is too small
    *   **Filter Clogging:** Filters can clog if the sample contains a lot of debris
*   **Filtering by gravity:**

    *   **Methanol:** An alcohol-based fixative that precipitates proteins
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Fixation Time:** The fixation time should be optimized to ensure adequate preservation without over-fixation

*   **Common Fixation Methods:**
    *   **Intracellular staining of cytokines:**
        *   The samples can be fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 10 minutes
        *   This will immobilize the cells without compromising the recognition of the intracellular molecule
    *   **Transcription factor staining:**
        *   The samples are fixed with formaldehyde to immobilize the cells
        *   The cells are permeabilized with methanol to allow the antibody access to the nucleus

## **Permeabilization** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of creating pores in the cell membrane to allow antibodies to access intracellular targets

    3.  **Washing:** Wash away unbound antibodies
    4.  **Counterstaining:** Use a counterstain (e.g., DAPI) to label all cells in the sample
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Antibody Selection:** Choose antibodies that are specific for the target antigen and that have been validated for flow cytometry
    *   **Antibody Titration:** Titrate antibodies to determine the optimal concentration for staining
    *   **Fluorophore Selection:** Choose fluorophores that have minimal spectral overlap and that are compatible with the flow cytometer's lasers and detectors
    *   **Staining Time and Temperature:** Optimize staining time and temperature to maximize signal intensity and minimize background noise
    *   **Controls:** Use appropriate controls to validate the staining protocol and to correct for background fluorescence
*   **Helpful Tip:**
    *   When performing surface staining, block the Fc receptors with Fc block to prevent nonspecific binding of the antibodies
