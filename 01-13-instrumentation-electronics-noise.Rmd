# Noise {-}

## **Overview of Noise** {-}

*   **Definition:** Noise refers to unwanted random electrical fluctuations or disturbances in an electronic system that can obscure or distort the desired signal
*   **Impact in Flow Cytometry:** Noise reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the instrument, making it difficult to detect weak signals and distinguish between closely spaced cell populations
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Randomness:** Noise is unpredictable and varies randomly over time
    *   **Amplitude:** Noise can have a range of amplitudes, from very small to relatively large
    *   **Frequency:** Noise can occur at a range of frequencies, from low to high
*   **Types of Noise in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Thermal Noise (Johnson Noise)
    *   Shot Noise
    *   Flicker Noise (1/f Noise)
    *   Electronic Interference
    *   Optical Noise
    *   Reagent Noise

## **Thermal Noise (Johnson Noise)** {-}

    *   **Temperature Dependent:** Increases with temperature
    *   **Frequency Independent:** Uniformly distributed across all frequencies (white noise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Reduce Temperature:** Cooling electronic components can reduce thermal noise, but this is not always practical
    *   **Use Low-Resistance Components:** Resistors with lower resistance generate less thermal noise
    *   **Minimize Bandwidth:** Reducing the bandwidth of the measurement system can reduce the amount of thermal noise that is detected
    *   **Shielding:** Protect the detector from external interferences
*   **Mathematical formula:**
    *   V<sub>RMS</sub> = √(4k<sub>B</sub>TRΔf)
        *   V<sub>RMS</sub>: Root mean square voltage (level of noise)
        *   k<sub>B</sub>: Boltzmann's constant
