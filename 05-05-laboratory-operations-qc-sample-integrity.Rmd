# Sample Inegrity {-}

## **Overview of Sample Integrity** {-}

*   **Definition:** Sample integrity refers to the degree to which a sample accurately represents the biological state of the cells or molecules of interest at the time of analysis
*   **Importance:**
    *   Accurate Results: Poor sample integrity can lead to inaccurate and unreliable results
    *   Reproducibility: Maintaining sample integrity is essential for reproducible experiments
    *   Valid Conclusions: Only high-quality samples can provide valid conclusions about the biological system being studied
*   **Key Factors Affecting Sample Integrity:**
    *   Collection
    *   Handling
    *   Storage
    *   Processing

## **Collection** {-}

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Proper Identification: Clearly label all sample tubes with patient or sample identifiers, date, and time of collection
    *   Appropriate Collection Tubes: Use appropriate collection tubes that are compatible with the sample type and downstream analysis
    *   Anticoagulants: Use appropriate anticoagulants (e.g., EDTA, heparin) to prevent clotting of blood samples
    *   Standardized Procedures: Follow standardized collection procedures to minimize variability and ensure consistency
    *   Quick Action: Record date and time and send to lab for timely processing.
*   **Specific Considerations:**
    *   Blood: Collect blood samples using a standardized phlebotomy technique
    *   Bone Marrow: Collect bone marrow aspirates using sterile techniques
    *   Solid Tissue: Collect tissue samples using appropriate surgical techniques
    *   Body Fluids: Collect body fluids using sterile techniques
*   **Actions to Avoid:**
    *   Collection delays
    *   Over or Under filling tubes

## **Handling** {-}

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Gentle Handling: Handle samples gently to avoid cell damage and aggregation
    *   Temperature Control: Maintain samples at appropriate temperatures to preserve cell viability and phenotype
    *   Proper Mixing: Mix samples gently to ensure that cells are evenly distributed
    *   Minimize Delays: Process samples as quickly as possible after collection
*   **Specific Considerations:**
    *   Light Exposure: Protect light-sensitive samples from prolonged exposure to light
    *   Vortexing: Avoid vigorous vortexing of samples, which can damage cells
*   **Actions to Avoid:**
    *   Forceful pipetting
    *   Leaving specimen out of collection container for long period of time

## **Storage** {-}

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Appropriate Temperature: Store samples at appropriate temperatures to preserve cell viability and phenotype
        *   *Room Temperature (18 - 25°C):* Good for some whole blood samples for short-term storage (check specific assay requirements)
        *   *Refrigerated (2 - 8°C):* Common for short-term storage of many sample types
        *   *-20°C or -80°C:* Often used for long-term storage of serum, plasma, or purified cell fractions
        *   *Liquid Nitrogen (-196°C):* For cryopreservation of cells, requires specific protocols and cryoprotective agents
    *   Cryopreservation: Cryopreserve samples in liquid nitrogen or at -80°C for long-term storage
    *   Stabilization Reagents: Use appropriate stabilization reagents (e.g., cell stabilizers) to prevent degradation during storage
    *   Controlled Thawing: Thaw cryopreserved samples rapidly and gently to minimize cell damage
*   **Actions to Avoid:**
    *   Thawing then refreezing specimen

## **Processing** {-}

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Standardized Protocols: Follow standardized processing protocols to minimize variability
    *   Reagent Quality: Use high-quality reagents that are free from contaminants
    *   Appropriate Techniques: Use appropriate techniques to isolate and purify cells
*   **Specific Considerations:**
    *   Red Blood Cell Lysis: Use appropriate lysing buffers and incubation times to remove red blood cells without damaging target cells
    *   Cell Washing: Use appropriate washing buffers and centrifugation speeds to remove unwanted debris and reagents
*   **Actions to Avoid:**
    *   Extended processing times
    *   Using harsh chemicals during processing

## **Methods for Assessing Sample Integrity** {-}

*   **Cell Viability Assays:**
    *   Trypan Blue Exclusion: Differentiates between live and dead cells based on membrane integrity
    *   Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining: Identifies cells with compromised membranes by binding to DNA
    *   7-AAD Staining: Another DNA-binding dye used to exclude non-viable cells
    *   Annexin V Apoptosis Detection: Detects cells undergoing apoptosis by binding to phosphatidylserine on the cell surface
*   **Visual Inspection:**
    *   Microscopic Evaluation: Examine samples under a microscope to assess cell morphology, aggregation, and presence of debris
*   **Automated Cell Counters:**
    *   Determine cell concentration and viability using automated cell counters with viability assessment capabilities
*   **Flow Cytometry Scatter Properties:**
    *   Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC): Assess cell size, granularity, and homogeneity. Shifts in these parameters can indicate changes in cell integrity
*   **RNA Integrity Number (RIN):**
    *   For RNA analysis, use RIN to assess the degradation of RNA
*   **Assessment of Surface Marker Expression:**
    *   Evaluate the expression of specific surface markers known to be sensitive to changes in cell state.

## **Troubleshooting Sample Integrity Issues** {-}

*   **Low Event Count:**
    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   Cell death during collection, handling, or storage
        *   Loss of cells during processing
    *   *Troubleshooting Steps:*
        *   Optimize collection, handling, and storage protocols

*   **High Background Noise:**
    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   Dead cells and debris
        *   Non-specific antibody binding
    *   *Troubleshooting Steps:*
        *   Remove dead cells and debris
