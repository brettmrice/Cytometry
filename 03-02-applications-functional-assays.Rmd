    *   **Assess Cell Activity:** To measure the production of cytokines, the expression of activation markers, or the activity of signaling pathways
    *   **Study Cell Function:** To investigate the mechanisms of cell function and the effects of various stimuli
    *   **Diagnose Diseases:** To diagnose and monitor diseases based on abnormal cell function
    *   **Evaluate Therapies:** To evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions
*   **Common Types of Functional Assays:**

    *   Calcium Flux Assay
    *   Phospho Flow Assay

## **Cytokine Assays** {-}

*   **Definition:** Cytokine assays measure the production of cytokines by cells, providing information about their activation state and function
*   **Types:**
    *   **Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS):**
        *   *Technique:* Cells are stimulated to produce cytokines, then fixed and permeabilized to allow antibodies to access intracellular cytokines
        *   *Advantages:* Can measure cytokine production by specific cell populations
        *   *Disadvantages:* Requires cell stimulation and permeabilization, which can affect cell viability and antibody binding
    *   **Cytokine Secretion Assays:**
        *   *Technique:* Cells are stimulated to secrete cytokines, which are then captured by antibodies on the cell surface or on beads
        *   *Advantages:* Can measure cytokine secretion without cell permeabilization
        *   *Disadvantages:* Requires specialized antibodies and may not be as sensitive as ICS
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Stimulation Conditions:** The choice of stimulus, concentration, and duration can affect cytokine production
    *   **Blocking Agents:** Use blocking agents to prevent cytokine secretion, allowing for accumulation of cytokines within the cell
    *   **Antibody Selection:** Choose antibodies that are specific for the target cytokines and that have been validated for flow cytometry
*   **Common cytokines:**
    *   **IL-2**
    *   **IL-4**
    *   **IL-6**
    *   **TNF-alpha**
    *   **IFN-gamma**
*   **How to optimize:**
    *   Stimulating the cells effectively with PMA and ionomycin for the appropriate amount of time
    *   Using GolgiPlug to retain the signal inside of the cells

## **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) Assay** {-}

*   **Definition:** CGD is a genetic disorder that affects the ability of phagocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
*   **Assay Principle:**
    *   The CGD assay measures the production of ROS by phagocytes in response to stimulation
    *   Cells are stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or other stimuli, and then incubated with a dye that fluoresces upon oxidation by ROS
    *   Flow cytometry is used to measure the fluorescence intensity of the cells, which is proportional to the amount of ROS produced
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Stimulation Conditions:** The choice of stimulus, concentration, and duration can affect ROS production
    *   **Dye Selection:** Choose a dye that is sensitive to ROS and that has minimal spectral overlap with other fluorochromes in the panel
    *   **Controls:** Include positive and negative controls to validate the assay
*   **Reagents and Supplies:**
    *   **Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR):** a nonfluorescent cell-permeable dye that can be oxidized by intracellular ROS to form the fluorescent product rhodamine
*   **Helpful Hints:**
    *   Whole blood samples must be tested within a reasonable timeframe
    *   Proper amount of DHR and PMA must be used
    *   The incubation temperature of the cell suspension must be at 37C

## **Calcium Flux Assay** {-}

*   **Definition:** The calcium flux assay measures the changes in intracellular calcium concentration in response to stimulation
*   **Assay Principle:**
    *   Cells are loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye, such as Fluo-4 or Indo-1
    *   The cells are then stimulated with an agonist that triggers calcium release from intracellular stores or influx from the extracellular environment
    *   Flow cytometry is used to monitor the fluorescence intensity of the cells over time, which is proportional to the intracellular calcium concentration
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Dye Loading:** Proper dye loading is essential for accurate measurements
    *   **Stimulation Conditions:** The choice of agonist, concentration, and duration can affect calcium flux
    *   **Instrument Setup:** The flow cytometer must be set up to acquire data rapidly over time
*   **How to optimize:**
    *   Use Indo-1 as a ratiometric dye to avoid the need to wash the dye
    *   Include a stimulant and ionophore to maximize the signal
    *   Maintain the cells at 37C throughout the run

## **Phospho Flow Assay** {-}

*   **Definition:** The phospho flow assay measures the phosphorylation status of intracellular proteins, providing information about the activation of signaling pathways
*   **Assay Principle:**
    *   Cells are stimulated to activate signaling pathways, then fixed and permeabilized to allow antibodies to access intracellular phosphoproteins
    *   The cells are then stained with antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated forms of the target proteins
    *   Flow cytometry is used to measure the fluorescence intensity of the cells, which is proportional to the level of phosphorylation
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Stimulation Conditions:** The choice of stimulus, concentration, and duration can affect protein phosphorylation
    *   **Fixation and Permeabilization:** Proper fixation and permeabilization are essential for preserving phosphoproteins
    *   **Antibody Selection:** Choose antibodies that are specific for the phosphorylated forms of the target proteins and that have been validated for flow cytometry
    *   **Add phosphatase inhibitors:** Ensure that the cell medium or staining buffer is supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors to minimize unwanted dephosphorylation

## **General Considerations for Functional Assays** {-}

*   **Cell Viability:**
    *   Many functional assays require live cells, so it is essential to maintain high cell viability throughout the experiment
    *   Use appropriate cell culture techniques and handling procedures to minimize cell stress
    *   Include a viability dye to exclude dead cells from analysis
*   **Controls:**
    *   Include appropriate controls to validate the assay and account for background noise
    *   Unstimulated controls, positive controls, and isotype controls are all important for functional assays
    *   For example, a positive control can be produced with the use of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin
*   **Compensation:**
    *   Spectral overlap is a common problem in flow cytometry, and it is essential to use proper compensation techniques to correct for spillover
    *   Use single-stain controls to accurately calculate compensation values
