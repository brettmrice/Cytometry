    *   Transcription factors (NF-κB, STAT3)
    *   Cell cycle proteins (Cyclin D1, p53)
    *   Surface receptors (CD4, CD8)
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Expression Level:** Consider the expression level of the target molecule and choose appropriate antibodies or probes
    *   **Post-Translational Modifications:** Consider any post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation) that may affect antibody binding
    *   **Protein-Protein Interactions:** Consider any protein-protein interactions that may affect the availability of the target molecule
*   **Antibody Selection:**
    *   Choose antibodies that are specific for the target molecule and that have been validated for flow cytometry
    *   Select antibodies that recognize specific isoforms or post-translational modifications of the target molecule
    *   Consider using a combination of antibodies to improve specificity

## **Connecting Target to Experimental Design** {-}

*   **Cell Type:** dictates how you collect and prepare your sample, select your surface marker antibodies, and design your gating strategy
*   **Subcellular Location:** determines whether you need permeabilization and influences your choice of dyes or specialized techniques like imaging flow cytometry
*   **Molecule:** guides your antibody selection, staining protocol optimization, and control design

## **Troubleshooting Target Identification Issues** {-}
