    *   Comply with Regulations: To comply with regulatory requirements and accreditation standards
*   **Key Components of Biosafety Procedures:**
    *   Biosafety Categories
    *   Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
    *   Specimen Transport and Preparation Precautions
    *   Aerosol Control
    *   Decontamination

## **Biosafety Categories (Biosafety Levels - BSLs)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A system for classifying biological agents based on their potential to cause disease and the severity of the disease
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Determine Appropriate Containment: To determine the appropriate level of containment and safety practices for working with different biological agents
    *   Protect Laboratory Workers: To protect laboratory workers from exposure to potentially infectious materials
*   **Biosafety Levels:**
    *   **Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1):**
        *   *Agents:* Agents that are not known to cause disease in healthy adults
        *   *Practices:* Standard microbiological practices, such as handwashing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
        *   *Facilities:* Basic laboratory facilities with standard equipment
        *   *Example Agents:* Non-pathogenic strains of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis
    *   **Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2):**
        *   *Agents:* Agents that can cause disease in humans but are not typically transmitted through the air
        *   *Practices:* BSL-1 practices, plus limited access, use of biological safety cabinets (BSCs), and appropriate waste disposal
        *   *Facilities:* BSL-1 facilities, plus self-closing doors and eyewash stations
        *   *Example Agents:* HIV, hepatitis B virus, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus
    *   **Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3):**
        *   *Agents:* Agents that can cause serious or potentially lethal disease and can be transmitted through the air
        *   *Practices:* BSL-2 practices, plus controlled access, respiratory protection, and specialized ventilation systems
        *   *Facilities:* BSL-2 facilities, plus sealed windows, filtered air exhaust, and negative air pressure
        *   *Example Agents:* Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, SARS-CoV-2
    *   **Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4):**
        *   *Agents:* Agents that can cause highly dangerous or lethal disease and for which there are no vaccines or treatments
        *   *Practices:* BSL-3 practices, plus complete isolation of the laboratory worker from the agent
        *   *Facilities:* BSL-3 facilities, plus a separate, sealed building with specialized ventilation and waste management systems
        *   *Example Agents:* Ebola virus, Marburg virus
* **Personnel must have proper training before working in these environments!**

## **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Equipment worn by laboratory workers to protect them from exposure to potentially infectious materials
*   **Common Types of PPE:**
    *   Gloves: Protect hands from contamination
    *   Gowns: Protect clothing from contamination
    *   Eye Protection (e.g., safety glasses, face shields): Protect eyes from splashes or aerosols
    *   Respiratory Protection (e.g., N95 respirators): Protect respiratory system from airborne pathogens
*   **Proper Use of PPE:**
    *   Select the appropriate PPE for the task being performed
    *   Inspect PPE for any damage or defects before use
    *   Put on PPE in the correct order
    *   Remove PPE carefully to avoid contamination
    *   Dispose of contaminated PPE properly
*  **PPE must be provided to every worker in the laboratory**

## **Specimen Transport and Preparation Precautions** {-}

*   **Proper Containment:** Use leak-proof containers to transport specimens
    *   Seal specimens to avoid any leak during the transportation process
*   **Appropriate Labeling:** Label all specimen containers with the biohazard symbol and the appropriate biosafety level
*   **Specimen Preparation in Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC):**
    *   Preparation involving infectious material must be performed in a BSC

## **Aerosols** {-}

*   **Definition:** Airborne particles that can carry infectious agents
*   **Sources of Aerosols in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Cell Sorting: High-pressure droplet formation can generate aerosols
    *   Pipetting: Forceful pipetting can generate aerosols
    *   Centrifugation: Improperly sealed centrifuge tubes can release aerosols
    *   Opening Specimen Containers: Opening containers with internal pressure can release aerosols
*   **Aerosol Control Measures:**
    *   Use Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs): To contain aerosols
    *   Use Sealed Centrifuge Rotors: To prevent aerosols from being released during centrifugation
    *   Use Safety Pipettes: To prevent aerosols from being generated during pipetting
    *   Disinfect Work Surfaces: Regularly disinfect work surfaces with appropriate disinfectant
*   **Instruments should be routinely inspected for aerosol reduction, as well as follow the operation and maintenance manual**

## **Decontamination** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of removing or neutralizing contaminants on surfaces or in materials
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Prevent Infections: To prevent the spread of infectious agents
    *   Create a Safe Working Environment: To create a safe working environment for laboratory workers
*   **Common Decontamination Methods:**
    *   Chemical Disinfection: Use of chemical disinfectants (e.g., bleach, alcohol) to kill or inactivate microorganisms
    *   Autoclaving: Use of high-pressure steam to sterilize equipment and materials
    *   Incineration: Burning contaminated materials to destroy infectious agents
*   **Choice of Disinfectant:**
    *   Select a disinfectant that is effective against the specific agents being used
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use
*   **Biohazardous waste must be discarded properly into biohazard disposal containers**

## **Emergency Procedures** {-}

*   **Spill Response:**
    *   Have a written spill response plan in place
    *   Provide spill kits with all of the necessary materials
*   **Exposure Response:**
    *   Have a written exposure response plan in place
    *   Provide medical attention if a worker has been exposed
*   **Training for all Laboratory Personnel:**
    *   Ensure that all laboratory personnel are trained in biosafety procedures
    *   Provide regular refresher training
