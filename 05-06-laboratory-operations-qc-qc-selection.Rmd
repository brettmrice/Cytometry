# QC Selection {-}

## **Overview of Sample Quality Controls (QC) Selection** {-}

*   **Definition:** Sample quality controls are substances or procedures used to monitor and validate the integrity of samples throughout the testing process
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Verify Sample Handling: To ensure that samples are collected, transported, stored, and processed correctly
    *   Assess Assay Performance: To validate the performance of flow cytometry assays using known positive and negative controls
    *   Detect Contamination: To identify contamination issues that may compromise the results
*   **Types of Quality Controls:**
    *   Internal Quality Controls (IQCs)
    *   External Quality Controls (EQCs)

## **Internal Quality Controls (IQCs)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Substances or procedures that are incorporated directly into the sample or assay workflow to monitor performance
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Monitor Sample Integrity: To assess the quality of the sample throughout the testing process
    *   Detect Matrix Effects: To identify any interference from the sample matrix that may affect the assay results
    *   Validate Assay Performance: To confirm that the assay is working as expected
*   **Types of IQCs:**
    *   Cell Markers
    *   Spiked Controls
    *   Reagent Blanks
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Matrix Effects: Be aware of the potential for matrix effects from the sample
    *   Appropriate Range: Choose IQCs with values that are within the clinically relevant range

### **Cell Markers as IQCs** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Some cell markers are known to be relatively stable and consistently expressed, making them useful as internal controls for immunophenotyping assays
*   **Examples:**
    *   CD45: A marker expressed on all leukocytes that can be used to verify proper leukocyte gating
    *   CD3: A marker expressed on all T cells that can be used to verify T cell gating
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Monitor the expression of these markers in each sample
    *   Compare the expression levels to historical data or to expected values
*   **What to look for:**
    *   Significant deviations from the expected expression levels may indicate problems with sample preparation, staining, or instrument performance

### **Spiked Controls** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Adding a known quantity of a reference material (e.g., cells, beads, proteins) to the sample to assess recovery and matrix effects
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use the recovery of the spiked control to correct for losses during sample preparation
    *   Compare the results to the expected values to identify matrix effects
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Monitor the integrity of surface staining on leukocytes from whole blood
    *   Verify cell count using enumeration beads

### **Reagent Blanks** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   A sample that contains all of the reagents used in the assay, but no sample
    *   Used to measure background signal and detect contamination
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Run the reagent blank alongside the experimental samples
    *   Subtract the signal from the reagent blank from the experimental samples
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Checking for any background fluorescence

## **External Quality Controls (EQCs)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Standardized samples or materials that are run periodically to assess the overall performance and accuracy of the entire flow cytometry process
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Verify Accuracy: Assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the flow cytometer
    *   Detect Systematic Errors: Identify systematic errors that may be affecting the results
    *   Comply with Regulations: Meet regulatory requirements and accreditation standards
*   **Types of EQCs:**
    *   Proficiency Testing (PT)
    *   Commercially Available Control Materials
    *   In-House Controls
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   EQCs are typically used to assess the performance of the entire flow cytometry process, from sample preparation to data analysis
    *   EQCs can also be used to compare the performance of different laboratories or different instruments

### **Proficiency Testing (PT)** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Participating in a PT program involves analyzing blinded samples provided by an external organization
    *   Comparing the results to those obtained by other laboratories
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Analyze the PT samples according to the PT provider's instructions
    *   Submit the results to the PT provider
    *   Review the PT report to identify any problems and implement corrective actions
*   **Helpful Tip:**
    *   PT programs provide a valuable way to assess the overall performance of the flow cytometry laboratory and to identify areas for improvement

### **Commercially Available Control Materials** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Using standardized control materials to monitor the performance of flow cytometry assays
    *   These materials are typically well-characterized and have known values for the parameters being measured
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Analyze the control materials according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Compare the results to the manufacturer's specifications
    *   Troubleshoot to identify if the control material is not within proper range
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   The control products may have been previously stained for use
    *   Control products may come as a mixture to simplify the QC process
    *   Beads or cell preps that target instrument performance checks

### **In-House Controls** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Preparing and characterizing control materials within the flow cytometry laboratory
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Collect and process samples from healthy donors or patients with known disease states
    *   Characterize the samples using validated flow cytometry assays
    *   Use the characterized samples as controls to monitor the performance of the assays
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Can be tailored to the specific needs of the flow cytometry laboratory
    *   Less expensive than commercially available control materials

## **Analyzing Control Data and Corrective Action** {-}

*   **Trend Analysis:**
    *   Track control data over time to identify trends or shifts in performance
    *   Use control charts or other statistical methods to monitor the data
*   **Corrective Action:**
    *   Establish corrective action procedures to address any problems identified by the control data
    *   Document all corrective actions taken

## **Troubleshooting Sample Quality Control Issues** {-}

*   **Controls Out of Range:**
    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   Reagent degradation
        *   Instrument malfunction
        *   Technician error
    *   *Troubleshooting Steps:*
        *   Replace suspect reagents, calibrate instruments, and review techniques
*   **Inconsistent Results:**
    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   Unstable Instruments
