# Mass Cytometry {-}

## **Overview of Mass Cytometry (CyTOF)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), is a technique that uses antibodies conjugated to heavy metal isotopes to quantify multiple cellular markers simultaneously
*   **Principle:**
    *   Cells are labeled with antibodies conjugated to unique heavy metal isotopes
    *   The cells are introduced into an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
    *   The ICP-MS atomizes and ionizes the cells, and then measures the mass-to-charge ratio of the metal isotopes
    *   The abundance of each metal isotope is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the cell, which in turn is proportional to the expression level of the target marker
*   **Advantages Over Traditional Flow Cytometry:**
    *   High Dimensionality: Can measure 40+ markers simultaneously, compared to the limited number of fluorochromes that can be used in traditional flow cytometry
    *   Minimal Spectral Overlap: Uses mass-to-charge ratio instead of fluorescence, eliminating the problem of spectral overlap
    *   High Sensitivity: Can detect low levels of protein expression
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Lower Throughput: Slower than traditional flow cytometry
    *   Cell Destruction: The cells are destroyed during the ionization process, preventing cell sorting
    *   Specialized Equipment: Requires a specialized mass cytometer
    *   High Cost: More expensive than traditional flow cytometry
*   **Applications:**
    *   Immunology
    *   Cancer Research
    *   Stem Cell Research
    *   Drug Discovery

## **Key Components of a Mass Cytometer** {-}

*   **Fluidics System:**
    *   Transports the cells from the sample tube to the nebulizer
    *   Maintains a stable and consistent flow rate
*   **Nebulizer:**
    *   Converts the liquid sample into a fine aerosol
*   **Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP):**
    *   A high-temperature plasma that atomizes and ionizes the sample
    *   The ICP is generated by passing argon gas through a radiofrequency field
*   **Mass Analyzer:**
    *   Separates the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio
    *   The mass analyzer in a CyTOF instrument is typically a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer
*   **Detector:**
    *   Detects the ions and measures their abundance
    *   The detector in a CyTOF instrument is typically an electron multiplier
*   **Software System:**
    *   Controls the instrument
    *   Acquires and processes the data
    *   Provides data visualization and analysis tools

## **Antibodies and Metal Conjugation** {-}

*   **Antibodies:**
    *   Use high-quality antibodies that are specific for the target markers
    *   Validate antibodies for use in mass cytometry
*   **Metal Conjugation:**
    *   Antibodies are conjugated to unique heavy metal isotopes using specialized conjugation kits
    *   The choice of metal isotope depends on its abundance, purity, and the availability of conjugation chemistry
*   **Examples of Metal Isotopes:**
    *   Lanthanides: 139La, 141Pr, 142Nd, 143Nd, 144Nd, 145Nd, 146Nd, 147Sm, 148Sm, 149Sm, 150Nd, 151Eu, 152Sm, 153Eu, 154Sm, 155Gd, 156Gd, 157Gd, 158Gd, 159Tb, 160Gd, 161Dy, 162Dy, 163Dy, 164Dy, 165Ho, 166Er, 167Ho, 168Er, 169Tm, 170Er, 171Yb, 172Yb, 173Yb, 174Yb, 175Lu, 176Yb
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Metal Purity:** Use high-purity metal isotopes to minimize background noise
    *   **Conjugation Efficiency:** Optimize the conjugation reaction to maximize the number of metal atoms per antibody molecule
    *   **Antibody Titration:** Titrate the metal-conjugated antibodies to determine the optimal concentration for staining
*   **Barcoding and debarcoding:**
    *   Use of a metal conjugated to a DNA linker to label the sample
    *   This allows for multiple samples to be combined and to be analyzed at the same time, saving time and resources
    *   This needs to be removed from the data prior to analysis

## **Sample Preparation for Mass Cytometry** {-}

*   **Cell Staining:**
    *   Label cells with metal-conjugated antibodies
    *   Use appropriate staining protocols to maximize signal intensity and minimize background noise
*   **Fixation and Permeabilization:**
    *   Fix and permeabilize the cells to preserve cell structure and allow antibody access to intracellular targets
    *   Use appropriate fixation and permeabilization methods for the target antigens
*   **DNA Intercalation:**
    *   Intercalate a metal-labeled DNA intercalator (e.g., iridium) into the DNA to allow for cell identification and doublet discrimination
*   **Washing:**
    *   Wash the cells thoroughly to remove unbound antibodies and other contaminants
*   **Filtration:**
    *   Filter the sample through a 35 um filter
*   **Cell Concentration:**
    *   Ensure that the cell concentration is within the optimal range for the mass cytometer

## **Data Analysis for Mass Cytometry** {-}

*   **Normalization:**
    *   Normalize the data to account for variations in instrument performance over time
    *   Use normalization beads to correct for signal drift
*   **Deconvolution:**
    *   Deconvolve the data to remove signal from metal isotopes that have overlapping mass-to-charge ratios
*   **Gating:**
    *   Use a hierarchical gating strategy to identify specific cell populations based on their marker expression
    *   Use appropriate controls to define gating boundaries
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Use visualization tools to explore the high-dimensional data
    *   Common visualization methods include t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and viSNE
*   **Clustering:**
    *   Use clustering algorithms to identify groups of cells with similar marker expression profiles
    *   Common clustering algorithms include k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering
