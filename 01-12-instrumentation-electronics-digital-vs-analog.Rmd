## **Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of converting a continuous analog signal into a discrete digital signal
*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   **Resolution:** The number of bits used to represent the digital signal (e.g., 8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit). Higher resolution means more discrete levels and greater accuracy
    *   **Sampling Rate:** The number of samples taken per second. Higher sampling rate means more accurate representation of the analog signal
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Sampling:** The analog signal is sampled at regular intervals.
    2.  **Quantization:** Each sample is assigned a discrete value based on its amplitude.
    3.  **Encoding:** The discrete values are encoded into binary digits (bits).
*   **Importance:**
    *   Enables the use of digital signal processing techniques
    *   Allows for accurate storage and transmission of data
    *   Provides a standardized format for data analysis
*   **Use case:**
    *   Older flow cytometers use 8-bit ADC, providing 256 possible values for each parameter
        *   If a cell population has a value greater than 256, it will appear at the maximum channel value and will not be able to be accurately measured. In this case, the data will be displayed as "off-scale"
    *   Newer flow cytometers use 16-bit ADC, allowing for the ability to measure over 65,000 values
