# Environmental Safety {-}

## **Overview of Environmental Safety** {-}

*   **Definition:** Environmental safety refers to the procedures and practices used to minimize the impact of laboratory operations on the environment
*   **Importance:**
    *   Protect the Environment: To prevent pollution of air, water, and soil
    *   Comply with Regulations: To comply with federal, state, and local regulations regarding waste disposal
    *   Promote Sustainability: To reduce the use of resources and minimize waste generation
*   **Key Aspects of Environmental Safety:**
    *   Waste Segregation
    *   Waste Disposal Procedures
    *   Recycling
    *   Resource Conservation

## **Waste Segregation** {-}

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Properly categorize waste to enable effective disposal
*   **Segregation Categories:**
    *   Biohazardous Waste:
        *   Definition: Waste that is contaminated with potentially infectious materials (e.g., blood, body fluids, cell cultures)
        *   Disposal: Must be autoclaved or incinerated to destroy infectious agents
        *   Containers: Should be collected in red biohazard bags or sharps containers
    *   Chemical Waste:
        *   Definition: Waste that contains hazardous chemicals (e.g., solvents, acids, bases, dyes)
        *   Disposal: Must be disposed of according to federal, state, and local regulations
        *   Containers: Should be collected in appropriate containers labeled with the type of waste and hazard warnings
    *   Radioactive Waste:
        *   Definition: Waste that contains radioactive materials
        *   Disposal: Must be disposed of according to federal, state, and local regulations
        *   Containers: Should be collected in appropriate containers labeled with the type of waste and the level of radioactivity
    *   Sharps Waste:
        *   Definition: Waste that consists of sharp objects (e.g., needles, syringes, scalpel blades)
        *   Disposal: Must be collected in puncture-resistant sharps containers to prevent injuries
    *   Recyclable Waste:
        *   Definition: Waste that can be recycled (e.g., paper, cardboard, glass, plastic)
        *   Disposal: Should be collected in designated recycling bins
    *   General Trash:
        *   Definition: Waste that is not contaminated with biohazards, chemicals, or radioactive materials
        *   Disposal: Can be disposed of in regular trash containers
*   **How to properly select container:**
    *   Select a container that is rigid, leak proof, and puncture resistant

## **Waste Disposal Procedures** {-}

*   **Biohazardous Waste:**
    *   Autoclaving: Autoclave biohazardous waste to sterilize it before disposal
    *   Incineration: Incinerate biohazardous waste to completely destroy infectious agents
*   **Chemical Waste:**
    *   Follow regulations for the disposal of chemical waste
    *   Use appropriate chemical-resistant collection containers
*   **Sharps Waste:**
    *   Dispose of sharps waste immediately after use
    *   Do not recap, bend, or break needles
    *   Do not overfill sharps containers
*   **Radioactive Waste:**
    *   Waste should be properly decontaminated per facility and regulation guidelines

## **Recycling** {-}

*   **Recycling Programs:**
    *   Implement recycling programs to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills
    *   Recycle paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and other materials
*   **Source Reduction:**
    *   Reduce the amount of waste generated by the laboratory
    *   Purchase products in bulk
    *   Use reusable equipment and supplies

## **Resource Conservation** {-}

*   **Energy Conservation:**
    *   Turn off lights and equipment when not in use
    *   Use energy-efficient lighting and equipment
    *   Optimize HVAC settings
*   **Water Conservation:**
    *   Reduce water consumption by using water-efficient equipment and practices
    *   Repair leaks promptly
    *   Use water-saving techniques for cleaning and sterilization
*   **Inventory Control:**
    *   Manage chemical inventories to minimize waste
    *   Use the oldest chemicals first
    *   Purchase chemicals only as needed

## **Emergency Procedures** {-}

*   **Spill Response:**
    *   Have a written spill response plan in place
    *   Provide spill kits with all of the necessary materials (e.g., absorbent pads, gloves, eye protection)
    *   Contain the spill and prevent it from spreading
    *   Clean up the spill using appropriate methods
    *   Report the spill to the appropriate authorities
*   **Exposure Response:**
    *   Have a written exposure response plan in place
    *   Provide immediate first aid
    *   Seek medical attention if necessary
    *   Report the exposure to the appropriate authorities

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Environmental Safety:** Protecting the environment from laboratory operations

*   **Chemical Waste:** Waste containing hazardous chemicals
*   **Sharps Waste:** Waste consisting of sharp objects
*   **Recycling:** Collecting and processing waste materials for reuse
*   **Source Reduction:** Reducing the amount of waste generated
*   **Energy Conservation:** Reducing energy consumption
*   **Water Conservation:** Reducing water consumption
