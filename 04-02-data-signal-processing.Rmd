# Signal Processing {-}

## **Overview of Signal Processing** {-}

*   **Definition:** Signal processing is the manipulation and analysis of signals to extract meaningful information and improve data quality
*   **Purpose in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Remove Noise: To reduce background noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio
    *   Correct for Artifacts: To correct for spectral overlap, cell doublets, and other artifacts
    *   Extract Features: To extract relevant features from the data, such as the mean fluorescence intensity or the cell cycle distribution
*   **Common Signal Processing Techniques:**
    *   Binning
    *   Compensation
    *   Pulse Processing
    *   Baseline Restoration
    *   Background Correction

## **Binning** {-}

*   **Definition:** A data reduction technique in which data points are grouped into discrete intervals or bins
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Reduce Data Size: To reduce the size of the data file
    *   Smooth Data: To smooth out noise and reduce variability
    *   Visualize Data: To create histograms or other visualizations of the data
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Divide the range of data values into a set of non-overlapping bins
    *   Count the number of data points that fall into each bin
    *   Replace the original data points with the bin number or the average value of the data points in the bin
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Bin Size: The size of the bins can affect the appearance of the data and the amount of information that is lost
    *   Number of Bins: The number of bins can affect the resolution of the data
*   **Use case example:**
    *   Creating histogram plots

## **Compensation** {-}

*   **Definition:** A mathematical process used to correct for spectral overlap between fluorochromes
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Accurate Quantification: To accurately quantify the expression of multiple antigens in a single sample
    *   Multi-Color Analysis: To allow for the use of multiple fluorochromes in a single experiment
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use compensation controls to calculate compensation values
    *   Apply a compensation matrix to the experimental data to remove the contribution of each fluorochrome from the other channels
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Compensation Controls: Use high-quality compensation controls
    *   Compensation Values: Verify compensation values
    *   Overcompensation and Undercompensation: Proper optimization is required
*   **Compensation is important due to the emission spectra!**
    *   Not all channels only detect the respective fluorochrome. A fluorochrome can spill into another channel's detection range.

## **Pulse Processing** {-}

*   **Definition:** A set of techniques used to analyze the shape and characteristics of the electrical pulses generated as cells pass through the laser beam in a flow cytometer
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Doublet Discrimination: to differentiate between single cells and cell aggregates
    *   Cell Sizing: to estimate cell size
    *   Signal Quantification: to accurately quantify the amount of fluorescence emitted by each cell
*   **Common Pulse Processing Parameters:**
    *   Area: the area under the pulse curve
    *   Width: the duration of the pulse
    *   Height: the peak amplitude of the pulse
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use pulse processing software to analyze the raw data from the flow cytometer
    *   Gate on single cells based on pulse area, width, and height
    *   Use pulse processing parameters to correct for variations in cell size and shape
*   **How it relates to voltage:**
    *   The electrical impulses correlate to voltage

## **Baseline Restoration** {-}

*   **Definition:** A process used to correct for baseline drift or offset in the flow cytometry data
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Accurate Quantification: To ensure that the fluorescence and scatter values accurately reflect the properties of the cells
    *   Data Comparison: To allow for comparison of data from different experiments
*   **Causes of Baseline Drift:**
    *   Instrument Instability
    *   Temperature Changes
    *   Electrical Noise
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Measure the baseline signal in a region of the data where there are no cells
    *   Subtract the baseline signal from all of the data points
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Baseline Location: Choose a baseline location that is representative of the entire data set
    *   Baseline Variability: Account for variations in the baseline signal over time

## **Background Correction** {-}

*   **Definition:** A process used to subtract background signal from the flow cytometry data
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Improve Sensitivity: To improve the sensitivity of the assay by reducing background noise
    *   Accurate Quantification: To ensure that the fluorescence values accurately reflect the expression of the target antigens
*   **Sources of Background Signal:**
    *   Autofluorescence: Natural emission of light by cells
    *   Non-Specific Antibody Binding: Binding of antibodies to unintended targets
    *   Electronic Noise: Noise generated by the flow cytometer electronics
*   **Methods for Background Correction:**
    *   Autofluorescence Subtraction: Subtract the autofluorescence signal from all of the data points
    *   Isotype Control Subtraction: Subtract the signal from the isotype control antibody from the experimental samples
    *   Gating: Exclude cells that are not of interest from the analysis
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Control Samples: Use appropriate control samples to measure the background signal
    *   Subtraction Method: Choose a subtraction method that is appropriate for the data
*   **For example:** when selecting the best FMO control to use

## **Troubleshooting Signal Processing Issues** {-}
