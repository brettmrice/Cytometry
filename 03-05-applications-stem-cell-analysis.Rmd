## **CD34 Absolute Counts** {-}

*   **CD34:**
    *   *Definition:* A cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells
    *   *Importance:* CD34 is a commonly used marker to identify and quantify HSCs
*   **CD34 Absolute Count:**
    *   *Definition:* The number of CD34+ cells per unit volume of blood or bone marrow

        *   Predicting engraftment after stem cell transplantation
        *   Monitoring stem cell mobilization
        *   Diagnosing and classifying hematologic disorders
*   **Methods for CD34 Absolute Counts:**
    *   **Single-Platform Flow Cytometry:**
        *   *Principle:* Uses a single flow cytometer to simultaneously measure the number of CD34+ cells and the total white blood cell count
        *   *Advantages:* More accurate and precise than dual-platform methods
    *   **Dual-Platform Flow Cytometry:**
        *   *Principle:* Uses a flow cytometer to measure the percentage of CD34+ cells and a hematology analyzer to measure the total white blood cell count
        *   *Advantages:* Less expensive than single-platform methods
        *   *Disadvantages:* Less accurate and precise than single-platform methods

## **Single-Platform Flow Cytometry for CD34 Absolute Counts** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   A known volume of sample is stained with antibodies against CD34 and other cell surface markers
    *   A known number of fluorescent beads is added to the sample as an internal control
    *   The sample is acquired on a flow cytometer, and the number of CD34+ cells and beads is counted
    *   The absolute count of CD34+ cells is calculated using the following formula:
        *   CD34+ cells/μL = (Number of CD34+ cells / Number of beads) x (Number of beads added / Sample volume in μL)

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Sample Preparation:**
        *   Collect blood or bone marrow aspirate in EDTA anticoagulant
        *   Lyse red blood cells (RBCs) using a lysing buffer
        *   Wash the sample to remove excess lysing buffer
    2.  **Antibody Staining:**
        *   Incubate the sample with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD34 and other cell surface markers (e.g., CD45)
        *   Include appropriate isotype controls
    3.  **Bead Addition:**
        *   Add a known number of fluorescent beads to the sample
    4.  **Flow Cytometry Acquisition:**
        *   Acquire the sample on a flow cytometer, following the manufacturer's instructions
        *   Collect a sufficient number of events to ensure accurate counting
    5.  **Data Analysis:**
        *   Gate on the CD45+ leukocyte population
        *   Identify the CD34+ cell population within the CD45+ gate
        *   Count the number of CD34+ cells and beads
        *   Calculate the absolute count of CD34+ cells using the formula above
*   **Reagents and supplies:**
    *   **CD45-FITC:** to gate on leukocytes
    *   **CD34-PE:** to determine the percent of hematopoietic stem cells
    *   **7-AAD:** to remove any dead cells from the analysis
    *   **Counting beads:** to determine the absolute counts

## **Gating Strategy for CD34 Absolute Counts** {-}

1.  **Gate on the Leukocyte Population:**
    *   Use CD45 and side scatter (SSC) to identify the leukocyte population
    *   Exclude red blood cells and debris
2.  **Gate on the CD34+ Population:**
    *   Use CD34 and side scatter (SSC) to identify the CD34+ cell population
    *   Exclude non-specific binding using isotype controls
3.  **Confirm CD34+ Population:**
    *   Use CD34 and CD45 to identify true CD34+ cells from the background noise
4.  **Bead Gate:**
    *   Use forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) to identify the beads population to count how many events are being tested.

## **Controls for CD34 Absolute Counts** {-}

*   **Isotype Controls:**
    *   Used to assess non-specific antibody binding
*   **Negative Controls:**
    *   Used to set the baseline for CD34 expression
*   **Positive Controls:**
    *   Used to validate the staining protocol and instrument performance
*   **Beads Controls:**
    *   Used to make sure that the beads are distinguishable from any debris that may be present in the sample
*   **Automated gating:**
    *   It is imperative that the gating is not automated to prevent the omission of a small CD34+ cell population
