# Threshold/Discriminator {-}

## **Overview of Threshold/Discriminator** {-}

*   **Definition:** A threshold, also known as a discriminator, is a set value that an electronic signal must exceed in order to be recorded as an event by the flow cytometer
*   **Purpose in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   **Reduce Noise:** To eliminate background noise and low-amplitude signals from being recorded as events
    *   **Discriminate Events:** To selectively record events of interest while ignoring unwanted events
    *   **Improve Data Quality:** By reducing noise and unwanted events, the overall quality of the data is improved
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Threshold Level:** The specific value that the signal must exceed
    *   **Trigger Parameter:** The parameter that is used to determine whether the threshold is exceeded (e.g., forward scatter, side scatter, fluorescence channel)
    *   **Event Recording:** Only events that exceed the threshold level are recorded and analyzed
    *   **Data Analysis:** The threshold setting can affect the number of events recorded and the overall distribution of data

## **Types of Thresholds** {-}

*   **Single Threshold:**
    *   *Definition:* A single value that the signal must exceed on a specific parameter
    *   *Example:* A threshold set on forward scatter to exclude debris and small particles
*   **Multiple Thresholds:**
    *   *Definition:* Multiple values that the signal must exceed on different parameters
    *   *Example:* A threshold set on forward scatter and a threshold set on side scatter to select a specific population of cells
*   **Software Thresholds:**
    *   *Definition:* Thresholds that are set and adjusted using software controls
    *   *Advantages:* More flexible and easier to adjust than hardware thresholds
*   **Hardware Thresholds:**
    *   *Definition:* Thresholds that are set using physical components on the flow cytometer
    *   *Advantages:* More stable and less susceptible to software glitches

## **Setting Thresholds** {-}

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Cell Type:** The size and complexity of the cells being analyzed
    *   **Fluorophore Brightness:** The intensity of the fluorescence signal
    *   **Background Noise:** The level of background noise in the system
    *   **Experimental Goals:** The specific objectives of the experiment
*   **Methods:**
    1.  **Visual Inspection:** Examine the data on a scatter plot or histogram to identify the region of interest
    2.  **Control Samples:** Use control samples (e.g., unstained cells) to determine the level of background noise
    3.  **Titration:** Titrate the threshold level to optimize the separation between positive and negative populations
    4.  **Automated Thresholding:** Use software algorithms to automatically set the threshold level based on the data

## **Trigger Parameter Selection** {-}

*   **Definition:** The parameter that is used to determine whether the threshold is exceeded
*   **Common Trigger Parameters:**
    *   **Forward Scatter (FSC):** Used to trigger on cells based on size
    *   **Side Scatter (SSC):** Used to trigger on cells based on granularity
    *   **Fluorescence Channel:** Used to trigger on cells based on fluorescence intensity
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Cell Population of Interest:** Select a trigger parameter that is expressed by the cell population of interest
    *   **Background Noise:** Avoid trigger parameters with high levels of background noise
    *   **Experiment Objectives:** Select a trigger parameter that is relevant to the specific objectives of the experiment

## **Impact of Threshold Settings** {-}

*   **Low Threshold:**
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Captures more events
        *   Detects rare cell populations
    *   *Disadvantages:*
        *   Increases noise
        *   Records unwanted events
        *   Decreases data quality
*   **High Threshold:**
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Reduces noise
        *   Records fewer unwanted events
        *   Improves data quality
    *   *Disadvantages:*
        *   Loses events
        *   May miss rare cell populations

## **Optimizing Threshold Settings** {-}

*   **Objective:** To find the optimal balance between capturing events of interest and reducing noise
*   **Strategies:**
    1.  **Start with a Low Threshold:** Begin with a low threshold to capture all possible events
    2.  **Gradually Increase the Threshold:** Gradually increase the threshold level while monitoring the data
    3.  **Monitor the Noise Level:** Pay close attention to the level of background noise
    4.  **Optimize Separation:** Adjust the threshold to optimize the separation between positive and negative populations
    5.  **Confirm with Controls:** Use control samples to confirm that the threshold setting is appropriate
*   **General Considerations:**
    *   If you are performing immunophenotyping, you will want to trigger on the cells of interest
        *   If you are performing immunophenotyping on lymphocytes, trigger on CD45
    *   If you are performing rare event analysis, you want to cast a very wide net by setting the threshold low
    *   If you want to remove any carryover from the sheath fluid as well as remove debris, you will want to set the threshold on forward scatter (FSC)

    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   High threshold setting
