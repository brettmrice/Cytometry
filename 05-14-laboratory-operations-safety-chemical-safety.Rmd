    *   *Content:* SDSs contain information about:
        *   Chemical Identification
        *   Hazards Identification
        *   Composition/Information on Ingredients
        *   First Aid Measures
        *   Fire-Fighting Measures
        *   Accidental Release Measures
        *   Handling and Storage
        *   Exposure Controls/Personal Protection
        *   Physical and Chemical Properties
        *   Stability and Reactivity
        *   Toxicological Information
        *   Ecological Information
        *   Disposal Considerations
        *   Transport Information
        *   Regulatory Information
    *   *How to Use SDSs:*
        *   Review the SDS before working with any hazardous chemical
        *   Identify the hazards associated with the chemical
        *   Follow the recommended safe handling procedures
*   **Labeling Requirements:**
    *   All chemical containers must be clearly labeled with the name of the chemical, hazard warnings, and precautionary statements
    *   Use labels that are durable and resistant to chemicals
    *   Replace damaged or missing labels immediately

## **Chemical Storage** {-}

*   **Proper Storage Areas:**
    *   Store chemicals in designated storage areas that are appropriate for the type of chemical
    *   Use cabinets, shelves, and containers that are compatible with the chemicals being stored
    *   Store flammable liquids in flammable storage cabinets
    *   Store corrosive chemicals in corrosion-resistant cabinets
*   **Segregation of Incompatible Chemicals:**
    *   Store incompatible chemicals separately to prevent dangerous reactions
    *   Use a chemical compatibility chart to determine which chemicals should not be stored together
*   **Storage Procedures:**
    *   Store chemicals in tightly closed containers
    *   Store chemicals at the recommended temperature
    *   Protect chemicals from sunlight and heat
    *   Do not store chemicals on the floor or in walkways
*   **Storage Requirements:**
    *   Review the labels and SDS to understand the proper storage procedures

## **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** {-}

*   **Types of PPE:**
    *   Gloves: Protect hands from contamination and chemical burns
    *   Eye Protection (e.g., safety glasses, face shields): Protect eyes from splashes or fumes
    *   Gowns or Lab Coats: Protect clothing from contamination
    *   Respiratory Protection (e.g., respirators): Protect the respiratory system from inhaling hazardous fumes or dusts
*   **PPE Usage:**
    *   Select the appropriate PPE for the task being performed
    *   Inspect PPE for any damage or defects before use
    *   Put on PPE in the correct order
    *   Remove PPE carefully to avoid contamination
    *   Dispose of contaminated PPE properly
*   **Safety tips to keep in mind:**
    *   Gloves should be changed immediately after contamination and at regular intervals
    *   Hands should be washed before putting on gloves and immediately after removing gloves

## **Handling and Disposal Procedures** {-}

*   **Using Chemicals in the Laboratory:**
    *   Follow established procedures for using chemicals in the laboratory
    *   Work in well-ventilated areas or use a chemical fume hood
    *   Use appropriate equipment for measuring and dispensing chemicals
    *   Avoid creating aerosols or dusts
    *   Clean up spills immediately
*   **Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures:**
    *   Segregate hazardous waste into appropriate containers
    *   Label all hazardous waste containers with the type of waste and the date of disposal
    *   Dispose of hazardous waste according to federal, state, and local regulations
*   **Never store chemicals down the drain**

## **Specific Chemical Hazards in Flow Cytometry** {-}

*   **Mutagenic Agents:**
    *   Definition: Chemicals that can cause mutations in DNA
    *   Examples: Ethidium bromide, propidium iodide
    *   Hazards: Can cause cancer or birth defects
    *   Safe Handling:
        *   Handle in a chemical fume hood
        *   Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
        *   Dispose of as hazardous waste
*   **Cytotoxic Agents:**
    *   Definition: Chemicals that are toxic to cells
    *   Examples: Formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol
    *   Hazards: Can cause cell damage or death
    *   Safe Handling:
        *   Handle in a chemical fume hood
        *   Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, lab coat, eye protection)
        *   Avoid skin contact or inhalation
        *   Dispose of as hazardous waste

## **Emergency Procedures** {-}
