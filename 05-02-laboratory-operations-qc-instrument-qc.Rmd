# Instrument QC {-}

## **Overview of Instrument Quality Control (QC)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Instrument quality control (IQC) refers to the procedures and practices used to ensure that a flow cytometer is operating according to its specifications and is producing accurate and reliable data
*   **Importance:**
    *   Data Accuracy: To ensure that the data accurately reflects the biological system being studied
    *   Reproducibility: To ensure that experiments can be reproduced over time
    *   Compliance: To comply with regulatory requirements and accreditation standards
*   **Key Aspects of Instrument Quality Control:**
    *   Optical Alignment
    *   Detector Calibration
    *   Fluidics System Checks
    *   Electronic Stability

## **Optical Alignment** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of ensuring that the lasers, lenses, mirrors, and detectors in the flow cytometer are properly aligned
*   **Importance:**
    *   Optimal Signal: To maximize the amount of light that reaches the detectors
    *   Consistent Performance: To ensure consistent performance of the flow cytometer over time
    *   Accurate Measurements: To ensure that the fluorescence and scatter measurements are accurate
*   **Methods:**
    *   Visual Inspection:
        *   Inspect the optical components for any signs of damage or misalignment
        *   Look for any obstructions or debris in the light path
    *   Alignment Beads:
        *   Use alignment beads to optimize the position of the lasers and detectors
        *   Adjust the alignment until the beads are centered in the flow cell and the signal intensity is maximized
    *   Software Tools:
        *   Use software tools to monitor the alignment of the optical system over time
        *   The software may provide guidance on how to adjust the alignment
*   **Troubleshooting Common Optical Misalignment Problems:**
    *   Weak Signals:
        *   Make sure there are no obstructions, and verify laser function.
    *   Variability:
        *   Use the QC beads to assess instrument performance.
        *   Clean, repair, or replace parts, as needed.
*   **General notes:**
    *   Optical alignment should occur when there are any known issues or at a fixed interval (e.g. weekly)

## **Detector Calibration** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of adjusting the voltages of the detectors (PMTs or APDs) to ensure that they are responding linearly to changes in light intensity
*   **Importance:**
    *   Accurate Quantification: To ensure that the fluorescence values accurately reflect the expression of the target antigens
    *   Data Comparison: To allow for comparison of data from different experiments or different instruments
*   **Methods:**
    1.  **Calibration Beads:**
        *   Use a set of calibration beads with known fluorescence intensities
        *   The calibration beads are typically labeled with a range of fluorescence intensities that span the range of the flow cytometer
    2.  **Voltage Adjustment:**
        *   Run the calibration beads on the flow cytometer
        *   Adjust the detector voltages until the fluorescence intensity values of the beads match their known values
    3.  **Linearity Check:**
        *   Verify that the detectors are responding linearly to changes in light intensity
        *   This can be done by plotting the fluorescence intensity values of the calibration beads against their known MESF values
*   **Linearity of Voltage should be carefully checked**

## **Fluidics System Checks** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of verifying that the fluidics system is functioning properly
*   **Importance:**
    *   Stable Flow Rate: To ensure a stable and consistent flow rate, which is essential for accurate cell counting and sizing
    *   Proper Focusing: To ensure that the cells are properly focused, which is essential for optimal signal intensity and resolution
    *   Prevention of Clogging: To prevent clogging of the flow cell or tubing, which can disrupt the flow of cells
*   **Methods:**
    *   Flow Rate Measurement:
        *   Measure the flow rate using a graduated cylinder and a timer
        *   Compare the measured flow rate to the expected flow rate
    *   Bubble Check:
        *   Inspect the tubing and flow cell for air bubbles
        *   Remove any air bubbles that are present
    *   Pressure Check:
        *   Monitor the pressure readings in the fluidics system
        *   Ensure that the pressure is within the acceptable range
*   **Examples of tests for fluidics system checks:**
    *   Verify that the sheath fluid is at the appropriate level
    *   Remove any air bubbles
    *   Clean the instrument with detergent, especially after running sticky samples

## **Electronic Stability** {-}

*   **Definition:** Assessing the stability of the flow cytometer's electronics, which can affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements
*   **Importance:**
    *   Ensure that the data is consistent.
    *   To allow results to be properly interpreted and to troubleshoot other aspects.
*   **Electronic stability can be affected by:**
    *   Room temperature fluctuation
    *   Variances from normal conditions
*   **How to troubleshoot:**
    *   Assess the flow rate and stability with calibration beads before and after running samples
