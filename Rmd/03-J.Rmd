# Cell Sorting {-}

## **Overview of Cell Sorting** {-}

*   **Cell Sorting:**
    *   *Definition:* A technique that uses flow cytometry to identify and physically separate cells based on their fluorescence and scatter properties
    *   *Also Known As:* Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Isolate Specific Cell Populations: To obtain pure populations of cells for downstream applications
    *   Enrich Rare Cells: To increase the frequency of rare cells for further analysis
    *   Study Cell Function: To study the function of specific cell populations in vitro or in vivo
*   **Applications:**
    *   Immunology
    *   Cell Biology
    *   Stem Cell Research
    *   Cancer Research
    *   Genomics

## **Principles of Cell Sorting** {-}

1.  **Sample Preparation:**
    *   Prepare a single-cell suspension of the sample
    *   Label the cells with fluorescent antibodies or dyes
    *   Filter the sample to remove cell aggregates and debris
2.  **Flow Cytometry Analysis:**
    *   Pass the cells through a flow cytometer, where their fluorescence and scatter properties are measured
    *   Identify the cell populations of interest based on their marker expression
3.  **Droplet Formation:**
    *   The flow cytometer creates droplets containing individual cells
    *   The timing of droplet formation is precisely controlled
4.  **Charging:**
    *   Droplets containing cells of interest are given an electrical charge
    *   The charge can be positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the desired sorting parameters
5.  **Deflection:**
    *   Charged droplets are deflected by an electric field into collection tubes
    *   Neutral droplets are not deflected and are discarded
6.  **Collection:**
    *   Sorted cells are collected in tubes for further analysis or culture

## **Key Components of a Cell Sorter** {-}

*   **Fluidics System:**
    *   Transports the cells from the sample tube to the sorting nozzle
    *   Maintains a stable and consistent flow rate
*   **Optics System:**
    *   Excites the fluorochromes on the cells
    *   Collects the emitted fluorescence and scattered light
    *   Directs the light to the detectors
*   **Electronics System:**
    *   Processes the signals from the detectors
    *   Identifies the cell populations of interest
    *   Controls the charging and deflection of the droplets
*   **Sorting Nozzle:**
    *   Forms droplets containing individual cells
    *   The size of the nozzle affects the size of the droplets and the sorting efficiency
*   **Deflection Plates:**
    *   Create an electric field that deflects the charged droplets into collection tubes
    *   The voltage applied to the deflection plates affects the degree of deflection
*   **Collection Tubes:**
    *   Collect the sorted cells
    *   Can be chilled to improve cell viability

## **Sorting Modes** {-}

*   **Purity Mode:**
    *   *Goal:* To maximize the purity of the sorted population
    *   *Settings:* Uses more stringent sorting criteria
    *   *Tradeoff:* May result in lower recovery
*   **Yield Mode:**
    *   *Goal:* To maximize the recovery of the sorted population
    *   *Settings:* Uses less stringent sorting criteria
    *   *Tradeoff:* May result in lower purity
*   **Single-Cell Mode:**
    *   *Goal:* To sort individual cells into separate wells or tubes
    *   *Settings:* Requires precise control of droplet formation and charging
    *   *Applications:* Cloning, single-cell sequencing

## **Considerations for Cell Sorting** {-}

*   **Cell Viability:**
    *   Cell sorting can be stressful for cells, so it is essential to maintain high cell viability
    *   Use appropriate cell culture techniques and handling procedures
    *   Use a viability dye to exclude dead cells from the sorting process
*   **Sterility:**
    *   Cell sorting must be performed under sterile conditions to prevent contamination
    *   Use sterile reagents and supplies
    *   Clean and disinfect the cell sorter regularly
*   **Carryover:**
    *   Carryover occurs when cells from one sample contaminate subsequent samples
    *   Minimize carryover by using appropriate washing procedures and by using a dedicated nozzle for each sample type
*   **Compensation:**
    *   Accurate compensation is essential for cell sorting
    *   Use single-stain controls to accurately calculate compensation values
    *   Verify compensation settings before sorting
*   **Drop Delay:**
    *   The drop delay is the time it takes for a cell to travel from the laser intercept to the droplet break-off point
    *   The drop delay must be accurately calibrated to ensure that the correct droplets are charged and deflected

## **Applications of Cell Sorting** {-}

*   **Immunology:**
    *   Isolating specific immune cell populations for functional studies
    *   Cloning T cell or B cell receptors
    *   Generating monoclonal antibodies
*   **Cell Biology:**
    *   Isolating cells with specific characteristics (e.g., size, shape, fluorescence intensity)
    *   Studying cell differentiation and development
    *   Generating stable cell lines
*   **Stem Cell Research:**
    *   Isolating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation
    *   Isolating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for regenerative medicine applications
    *   Studying stem cell differentiation and self-renewal
*   **Cancer Research:**
    *   Isolating cancer stem cells
