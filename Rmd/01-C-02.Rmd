## **Overview of Detectors** {-}

*   **Definition:** Detectors are electronic components that convert light into an electrical signal
*   **Purpose in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   **Convert Light to Electrons:** Detect and convert the photons emitted from fluorophores or scattered by cells into electrical signals
    *   **Amplify the Signal:** Increase the strength of the electrical signal for accurate measurement
    *   **Provide Data for Analysis:** Generate the raw data that is used to quantify fluorescence intensity and cell characteristics
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   **Sensitivity:** The ability to detect weak light signals
    *   **Quantum Efficiency:** The percentage of incident photons that are converted into electrons
    *   **Gain:** The factor by which the detector amplifies the signal
    *   **Dynamic Range:** The range of light intensities that the detector can accurately measure
    *   **Linearity:** The ability of the detector to produce an output signal that is proportional to the input light intensity
    *   **Response Time:** The speed at which the detector responds to changes in light intensity
    *   **Noise:** The unwanted electrical fluctuations generated by the detector itself
*   **Types of Detectors Used in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)
    *   Photodiodes
    *   Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Cameras
    *   Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs)

## **Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)** {-}

*   **Principle:** PMTs use the photoelectric effect and secondary emission to convert a single photon into a cascade of electrons, resulting in a highly amplified signal
*   **Components:**
    *   **Photocathode:** A light-sensitive material that emits electrons when struck by photons (photoelectric effect)
    *   **Dynodes:** A series of electrodes with increasingly positive voltages that attract and multiply the electrons through secondary emission
    *   **Anode:** Collects the electrons and generates an electrical current proportional to the number of photons detected
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **High Sensitivity:** Can detect very weak light signals
    *   **High Gain:** Provides significant signal amplification
    *   **Fast Response Time:** Can respond quickly to changes in light intensity
    *   **Relatively High Noise:** Generates some background noise due to thermal emission of electrons
    *   **Sensitive to Light Exposure:** Can be damaged by exposure to bright light when not powered
*   **Advantages:**
    *   High sensitivity and gain
    *   Fast response time
    *   Well-established technology
*   **Disadvantages:**

*   **Caveats:**
    *   PMTs can be damaged with exposure to light when the instrument is turned off
    *   PMTs tend to heat up and can change over the course of the experiment
