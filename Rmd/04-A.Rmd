# Standards {-}

## **Overview of Data Standards** {-}

*   **Definition:** Data standards are a set of guidelines and specifications that ensure data is collected, stored, and analyzed in a consistent and reproducible manner
*   **Importance:**
    *   Data Sharing: Facilitates data sharing and collaboration among researchers
    *   Reproducibility: Ensures that experiments can be reproduced by others
    *   Data Integration: Enables the integration of data from different experiments and different laboratories
    *   Long-Term Archiving: Ensures that data can be accessed and analyzed in the future
*   **Key Data Standards in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Image File Format
    *   FCS Format
    *   Listmode
    *   MIFlowCyt Checklist
    *   Storage Requirements

## **Image File Format** {-}

*   **Definition:** The format in which images from imaging flow cytometers are stored
*   **Common Formats:**
    *   TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): A flexible and widely supported format for storing images
    *   JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): A lossy compression format that is suitable for storing images with complex scenes
    *   PNG (Portable Network Graphics): A lossless compression format that is suitable for storing images with sharp lines and text
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Lossy vs. Lossless Compression: Lossy compression reduces file size but can also reduce image quality; lossless compression preserves image quality but results in larger file sizes
    *   Metadata: The image file should contain metadata that describes the image, such as the date and time it was acquired, the instrument settings, and the staining protocol
* **For flow cytometry, it is recommend to keep all files in the lossless compression to maintain image quality**

## **FCS Format (Flow Cytometry Standard)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A data file format specifically designed for flow cytometry data
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Standardize data storage: Provides a standardized way to store flow cytometry data, ensuring that it can be read and analyzed by different software packages
    *   Preserve Metadata: Stores metadata about the experiment, such as the instrument settings, the sample preparation protocol, and the antibody information
*   **Versions:**
    *   FCS 2.0: The original FCS standard, released in 1990
    *   FCS 3.0: An updated version of the FCS standard, released in 1997
    *   FCS 3.1: A further updated version of the FCS standard, released in 2010
*   **Structure:**
    *   Header: Contains information about the FCS file, such as the version number and the location of the text and data segments
    *   Text Segment: Contains metadata about the experiment, such as the instrument settings, the sample preparation protocol, and the antibody information
    *   Data Segment: Contains the raw data from the flow cytometer, such as the fluorescence and scatter values for each cell
* **FCS files must include the following:**
    *   Keywords: instrument settings (e.g. PMT voltages)
    *   Units: values or parameters
    *   Scaling: such as linear or logarithmic

## **Listmode Data** {-}

*   **Definition:** A method of storing flow cytometry data in which each event (cell or particle) is recorded as a list of values for each parameter being measured
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Flexibility: Allows for the analysis of the data using different gating strategies and analysis methods
    *   Preservation of Raw Data: Preserves the raw data from the flow cytometer, allowing for reanalysis of the data in the future
*   **Storage:**
    *   Listmode data is typically stored in FCS files
    *   The data segment of the FCS file contains the listmode data
*   **Parameters:**
    *   Each parameter in the listmode data corresponds to a specific measurement made by the flow cytometer, such as forward scatter, side scatter, or fluorescence intensity

## **MIFlowCyt Checklist (Minimum Information About a Flow Cytometry Experiment)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A checklist of the minimum information that should be reported about a flow cytometry experiment to ensure reproducibility and data quality
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Promote Transparency: Encourages researchers to be transparent about their methods and results
    *   Improve Reproducibility: Provides a standardized way to report flow cytometry experiments, making it easier for others to reproduce the results
    *   Enhance Data Quality: Ensures that all relevant information is included in the data analysis
*   **Categories:**
    *   Experiment Information: Details about the experiment, such as the title, the date, and the investigators
    *   Sample Information: Details about the samples being analyzed, such as the source, the treatment, and the cell type
    *   Instrument Information: Details about the flow cytometer used, such as the manufacturer, the model number, and the laser configuration
    *   Reagent Information: Details about the antibodies and dyes used, such as the manufacturer, the clone number, and the fluorochrome
    *   Data Analysis Information: Details about the data analysis methods used, such as the gating strategy and the compensation method
* **Before submitting a study report, be sure that the MI flow Cyt checklist has been reviewed!**

## **Storage Requirements** {-}

*   **File Size:** Flow cytometry data files can be quite large, especially for high-dimensional experiments
*   **Storage Media:**
    *   Use reliable storage media, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, or cloud storage
    *   Back up the data regularly to prevent data loss
*   **Long-Term Archiving:**
    *   Store the data in a format that is likely to be readable in the future (e.g., FCS)
    *   Include metadata that describes the experiment and the data analysis methods
    *   Consider using a data repository to archive the data

## **Practical Data Management Tips** {-}

*   **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
    *   Develop and adhere to a consistent naming convention for files and folders
    *   Include information about the experiment, the date, and the sample in the file name
*   **Folder Organization:**
    *   Organize data into folders based on experiment, date, or other relevant criteria
    *   Use a hierarchical folder structure to make it easy to find data
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Keep detailed notes about the experiment, the data analysis methods, and any problems that were encountered
    *   Store the notes in a text file or spreadsheet in the same folder as the data
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Use version control software to track changes to data and analysis scripts
    *   This makes it easy to revert to previous versions if needed
