# Instrument Safety {-}

## **Overview of Instrument Safety** {-}

*   **Definition:** Instrument safety refers to the procedures and practices used to prevent accidents and injuries related to the operation, maintenance, and repair of flow cytometers
*   **Importance:**
    *   Protect Laboratory Workers: Prevent electrical shocks, burns, eye injuries, and other hazards
    *   Prevent Equipment Damage: Protect the flow cytometer from damage due to improper use or maintenance
    *   Comply with Regulations: Meet regulatory requirements and accreditation standards
*   **Key Aspects of Instrument Safety:**
    *   Laser Safety
    *   Electrical Safety
    *   Mechanical Safety
    *   Emergency Shutdown Procedures

## **Laser Safety** {-}

*   **Lasers in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Lasers are used as the light source for excitation
    *   Lasers can be hazardous if not used properly
*   **Laser Safety Hazards:**
    *   Eye Damage: Direct or reflected laser beams can cause serious eye damage, including blindness
    *   Skin Burns: High-power lasers can cause skin burns
    *   Fire Hazard: Lasers can ignite flammable materials
*   **Laser Safety Measures:**
    *   Laser Safety Training: All personnel who work with lasers must receive laser safety training
    *   Laser Safety Officer: A designated individual who is responsible for overseeing laser safety in the laboratory
    *   Engineering Controls:
        *   Enclosed Laser Systems: Use flow cytometers with enclosed laser systems
        *   Interlocks: Interlocks prevent the laser from operating when the enclosure is open
        *   Beam Blocks: Use beam blocks to prevent accidental exposure to the laser beam
    *   Administrative Controls:
        *   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Follow written procedures for laser operation and maintenance
        *   Limited Access: Restrict access to the laser area to authorized personnel
        *   Warning Signs: Post warning signs to alert personnel to the presence of lasers
    *   Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
        *   Laser Safety Eyewear: Wear appropriate laser safety eyewear that is designed for the specific wavelengths of the lasers being used
        *   Skin Protection: Wear gloves and long sleeves to protect skin from exposure to laser beams
*   **Laser safety is dictated based on the class of the laser**

## **Electrical Safety** {-}

*   **Electrical Hazards:**
    *   Electrical Shock: Contact with live electrical components can cause electrical shock, which can be fatal
    *   Electrical Burns: High-voltage equipment can cause electrical burns
    *   Fire Hazard: Electrical malfunctions can cause fires
*   **Electrical Safety Measures:**
    *   Qualified Personnel: Only qualified personnel should perform electrical work on flow cytometers
    *   Equipment Grounding: Ensure that the flow cytometer is properly grounded
    *   Circuit Protection: Use circuit breakers and fuses to protect against overloads and short circuits
    *   Insulation: Ensure that all electrical wires and components are properly insulated
    *   Lockout/Tagout Procedures: Follow lockout/tagout procedures when performing maintenance or repairs
*   **How to be mindful of electrical safety:**
    *   Never use around water, and use surge protectors

## **Mechanical Safety** {-}

*   **Mechanical Hazards:**
    *   Moving Parts: Flow cytometers have moving parts, such as pumps and robotic arms, that can cause injuries
    *   Puncture Wounds: Needles and other sharp objects can cause puncture wounds
    *   Ergonomic Hazards: Repetitive motions and awkward postures can cause musculoskeletal injuries
*   **Mechanical Safety Measures:**
    *   Equipment Guards: Use equipment guards to protect against moving parts
    *   Needle Safety Devices: Use needle safety devices to prevent accidental needle sticks
    *   Ergonomic Workstations: Design workstations to minimize repetitive motions and awkward postures
    *   Proper Lifting Techniques: Use proper lifting techniques to avoid back injuries
*   **Consider the weight of the instrument, and ensure that you can properly and safely lift the parts**

## **Emergency Shutdown Procedures** {-}

*   **Emergency Situations:**
    *   Fire
    *   Electrical Shock
    *   Spill of Hazardous Materials
    *   Equipment Malfunction
*   **Emergency Shutdown Procedures:**
    *   Know the location of the emergency shutdown switch
    *   Turn off the power to the flow cytometer
    *   Evacuate the laboratory
    *   Contact emergency personnel
