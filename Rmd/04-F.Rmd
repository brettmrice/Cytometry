# Data Modeling {-}

## **Overview of Data Modeling Techniques** {-}

*   **Definition:** Data modeling techniques are computational methods used to create simplified representations of complex flow cytometry data, enabling the extraction of meaningful biological information
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Simplify Data: To reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data
    *   Identify Patterns: To identify patterns and trends in the data
    *   Make Predictions: To predict the behavior of cells or cell populations
*   **Common Data Modeling Techniques:**
    *   Cell Cycle Analysis
    *   Proliferation Modeling
    *   Phenotyping Modeling
    *   Ratiometric Analysis
    *   High Dimensionality Reduction

## **Cell Cycle Analysis** {-}

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Determine the proportions of cells in different phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1, S, G2/M)
    *   Identify cell cycle abnormalities
    *   Assess the effects of drugs or other treatments on cell cycle progression
*   **Methods:**
    *   DNA Content Analysis:
        *   Use DNA-binding dyes (e.g., propidium iodide, DAPI) to measure the DNA content of cells
        *   Model the cell cycle distribution using software algorithms
    *   Cell Cycle Marker Analysis:
        *   Use antibodies against cell cycle markers (e.g., Ki-67, Cyclin B1, pHH3) to identify cells in specific phases of the cell cycle
        *   Combine DNA content analysis with cell cycle marker analysis to improve the accuracy of the results
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Doublets: Remove cell doublets from the analysis
    *   Debris: Exclude debris from the analysis
    *   Cell Aggregation: Minimize cell aggregation to improve resolution

## **Proliferation Modeling** {-}

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Measure the rate of cell division
    *   Track cell generations
    *   Assess the effects of drugs or other treatments on cell proliferation
*   **Methods:**
    *   Cell Division Tracking Dyes:
        *   Use dyes that are divided equally between daughter cells upon cell division (e.g., CFSE, CellTrace Violet)
        *   Analyze the data using software algorithms to identify cell generations
    *   BrdU Incorporation:
        *   Use bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label cells that are actively synthesizing DNA
        *   Measure BrdU incorporation using flow cytometry
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Dye Toxicity: Choose dyes that are non-toxic to cells
    *   Dye Retention: Ensure that the dye is retained by cells for the duration of the experiment
    *   Cell Culture Conditions: Maintain consistent cell culture conditions

## **Phenotyping Modeling** {-}

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identify and classify cell populations based on their marker expression profiles
    *   Study the relationships between different cell populations
    *   Identify novel cell subsets
*   **Methods:**
    *   Gating:
        *   Use a hierarchical gating strategy to identify cell populations based on their marker expression
        *   Use Boolean gating to combine multiple markers and define complex cell populations
    *   Clustering:
        *   Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group cells based on their similarity
        *   Identify cell populations based on the clusters
    *   Dimensionality Reduction:
        *   Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to reduce the complexity of the data and visualize cell populations in a lower-dimensional space
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Marker Selection: Choose appropriate markers to identify the cell populations of interest
    *   Gating Strategy: Use a consistent gating strategy
    *   Clustering Algorithm: Choose a clustering algorithm that is appropriate for the data

## **Ratiometric Analysis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A data analysis technique used in flow cytometry that involves calculating the ratio of two or more parameters for each cell or event.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Normalize Data: To normalize data for variations in cell size, shape, or instrument settings
    *   Identify Ratios of Interest: To identify relationships between different cellular components or processes.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Receptor-Ligand Binding: Measuring the ratio of bound ligand to total receptor expression.
    *   Cell Signaling Studies: Assessing the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein levels to assess the activation status of signaling pathways.
    *   Cellular Health Assessment: Evaluating ratios of mitochondrial membrane potential or redox state to total cellular volume.
*   **Calculations:**
    *   The ratio is calculated by dividing the value of one parameter by the value of another parameter
    *   For example, the ratio of CD4 to CD8 expression can be calculated by dividing the CD4 fluorescence intensity by the CD8 fluorescence intensity
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Normalization: Ratiometric analysis can normalize data for variations in cell size, shape, or instrument settings
    *   Sensitivity: Ratiometric analysis can increase the sensitivity of the assay by reducing background noise
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Can be difficult to interpret if the data is noisy or if the relationship between the parameters is complex
*   **Examples:**
    *   Calcium Flux Assays: Use the ratio of calcium-bound dye to unbound dye to measure changes in intracellular calcium concentration
    *   Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assays: Use the ratio of two dyes with different sensitivities to membrane potential to measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential

## **High Dimensionality Reduction** {-}

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Visualize high dimensional data
    *   Uncover biological relationships
    *   Highlight patterns
*   **Methods:**
    *   **t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE):**
        *   Goal: reduce higher dimensional data into 2-3 dimensions
        *   Preserves local structure of data points, with similar cells appearing next to each other
    *   **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP):**
        *   Similar to t-SNE
        *   Also focuses on creating low dimensional embeddings and preserving structure
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   The results must be interpreted with care, as the low-dimensional representation may not accurately reflect all of the relationships in the high-dimensional data
    *   Use visualization tools to explore the data and identify patterns or trends
*   **When using these data sets, it can be difficult to analyze because all of the cells look like one, singular population**
