# Statistical Methods {-}

## **Overview of Statistical Methods** {-}

*   **Definition:** Statistical methods are mathematical procedures used to summarize, analyze, and interpret data. In flow cytometry, statistical methods are used to quantify cell populations, compare different treatment groups, and identify patterns in high-dimensional data
*   **Importance:**
    *   Objective Analysis: Provides objective and quantitative measures of cellular characteristics
    *   Statistical Significance: Allows for the determination of whether differences between groups are statistically significant
    *   Data Reduction: Provides methods for reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data
*   **Common Statistical Methods in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Central Tendency
    *   Standard Deviation
    *   Coefficient of Variation (CV)
    *   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistics
    *   Cluster Analysis
    *   Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    *   Discriminant Analysis

## **Central Tendency** {-}

*   **Definition:** A measure of the typical or central value in a set of data
*   **Common Measures of Central Tendency:**
    *   Mean: The average of all the values
    *   Median: The middle value when the values are arranged in order
    *   Mode: The value that occurs most frequently
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Mean: The mean is sensitive to outliers, so it may not be the best measure of central tendency for data sets with extreme values
    *   Median: The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean
    *   Data Distribution: The choice of measure of central tendency depends on the distribution of the data
*   **Applications in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Measuring the average expression of a cell surface marker
    *   Comparing the expression levels of a marker in different treatment groups

## **Standard Deviation** {-}

*   **Definition:** A measure of the spread or variability of a set of data
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Small Standard Deviation: Indicates that the data points are clustered closely around the mean
    *   Large Standard Deviation: Indicates that the data points are more spread out
*   **Applications in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Assessing the variability in cell marker expression
    *   Comparing the homogeneity of cell populations
*   **Mathematical formula:**
    *   s = √(∑(xᵢ - x̄)² / (n - 1))
        *   s: sample standard deviation
        *   xᵢ: the ith observation from the data
        *   x̄: the sample mean
        *   n: the number of observations in the data

## **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A measure of the relative variability of a set of data, expressed as a percentage
*   **Formula:** CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) x 100
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Unitless: Allows for comparison of variability across different data sets with different units of measurement
    *   Relative Measure: Provides a relative measure of variability that is independent of the mean
*   **Applications in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Assessing the precision of flow cytometry measurements
    *   Comparing the variability of cell marker expression in different treatment groups

## **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistics** {-}

*   **Definition:** A non-parametric test that is used to compare two samples and determine whether they come from the same distribution
*   **Principle:**
    *   Calculates the maximum distance between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the two samples
    *   A larger KS statistic indicates a greater difference between the two distributions
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Non-Parametric: Does not assume that the data follows a specific distribution
    *   Sensitive: Can detect small differences between distributions
*   **Applications in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Comparing the cell cycle distributions of different treatment groups
    *   Determining whether two cell populations are significantly different in terms of their marker expression
*   **Formula for determining KS distance:**
    *   D = max |CDF₁(x) - CDF₂(x)|
        *   CDF₁: cumulative distribution function of the first sample
        *   CDF₂: cumulative distribution function of the second sample
        *   x: data value

## **Cluster Analysis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A set of techniques used to group data points into clusters based on their similarity
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identify Cell Populations: To identify distinct cell populations in a flow cytometry data set
    *   Reduce Data Complexity: To reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data by grouping similar cells together
*   **Common Clustering Algorithms:**
    *   K-Means Clustering: Partitions the data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean
    *   Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters
    *   Density-Based Clustering: Identifies clusters based on the density of data points
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Choice of Algorithm: The choice of clustering algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis
    *   Number of Clusters: The number of clusters must be specified or determined using a cluster evaluation metric
*   **Helpful Tip:**
    *   To determine the appropriate number of clusters to use, the elbow method can be used.

## **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A dimensionality reduction technique that is used to transform a high-dimensional data set into a lower-dimensional data set while preserving as much of the variance in the data as possible
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Reduce Data Complexity: To reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data by identifying the principal components that explain the most variance
    *   Visualize Data: To visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Calculates the principal components of the data set
    *   The principal components are ordered by the amount of variance that they explain
    *   The first few principal components are typically used to represent the data
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Reduces Data Complexity
    *   Identifies Important Variables
    *   Visualizes High-Dimensional Data
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Data Interpretation Can Be Difficult
    *   Non-Linear Relationships May Be Missed

## **Discriminant Analysis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A statistical method used to classify data points into different groups based on their characteristics
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identify Cell Populations: To identify and classify cells into different populations based on their marker expression
    *   Predict Group Membership: To predict the group membership of new data points
*   **Types of Discriminant Analysis:**
    *   Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and that the covariance matrices of the different groups are equal
    *   Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA): Allows for different covariance matrices for the different groups
*   **Applications in Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Classifying cells into different cell types based on their marker expression
    *   Predicting the response of cells to a treatment based on their marker expression
*   **The user must select which category the population will fall under**

## **Considerations for Selecting Statistical Tests** {-}

*   **Type of Data:**
    *   Nominal data (categories): Use chi-square tests
    *   Ordinal data (ranked data): Use non-parametric tests
    *   Continuous data (numerical data): Use parametric tests (if data meets assumptions) or non-parametric tests
*   **Number of Groups:**
    *   Two groups: Use t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests
    *   Three or more groups: Use ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests
*   **Assumptions of Parametric Tests:**
    *   Normality: The data should follow a normal distribution
    *   Homogeneity of Variance: The variance should be equal across groups
    *   Independence: The data points should be independent of each other
*   **Data analysis often requires multiple tests to answer different research questions**
