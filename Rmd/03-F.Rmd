# Cell Cycle {-}

## **Overview of Cell Cycle and DNA Ploidy Analysis** {-}

*   **Cell Cycle:**
    *   **Definition:** The series of events that a cell undergoes from one division to the next
    *   **Phases:**
        *   G0 (Quiescence): A resting phase where cells are not actively dividing
        *   G1 (Gap 1): The cell grows and prepares for DNA replication
        *   S (Synthesis): DNA replication occurs
        *   G2 (Gap 2): The cell continues to grow and prepares for cell division
        *   M (Mitosis): The cell divides into two daughter cells
*   **DNA Ploidy:**
    *   **Definition:** The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell
    *   **Normal Ploidy:** Diploid (2n) cells have two sets of chromosomes
    *   **Abnormal Ploidy:** Aneuploid cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes
*   **Importance of Cell Cycle and DNA Ploidy Analysis:**
    *   **Cell Proliferation:** To measure the rate of cell division and identify factors that regulate cell growth
    *   **Cancer Diagnosis:** To identify and characterize tumors based on their cell cycle distribution and DNA ploidy
    *   **Drug Discovery:** To screen for drugs that affect cell cycle progression
    *   **Toxicology:** To assess the toxicity of chemicals on cell proliferation

## **Methods for Cell Cycle and DNA Ploidy Analysis** {-}

*   **DNA-Binding Dyes:**
    *   *Principle:* Dyes that bind to DNA and fluoresce proportionally to the amount of DNA present
    *   *Examples:*
        *   Propidium Iodide (PI): A dye that binds to DNA and emits red fluorescence
        *   7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD): A dye that binds to DNA and emits far-red fluorescence
        *   DAPI: A dye that binds to DNA and emits blue fluorescence
        *   Hoechst 33342: A dye that binds to DNA and emits blue fluorescence
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Cell Preparation:**
        *   Fix cells to preserve their DNA content
        *   Permeabilize cells to allow the DNA-binding dye to enter
    2.  **DNA Staining:**
        *   Incubate cells with the DNA-binding dye
        *   Ensure that the dye is evenly distributed throughout the sample
    3.  **Flow Cytometry Acquisition:**
        *   Acquire the samples on a flow cytometer
        *   Collect a sufficient number of events to ensure accurate analysis
    4.  **Data Analysis:**
        *   Analyze the data using software that can model the cell cycle distribution
        *   Calculate the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle

## **Interpreting Cell Cycle Histograms** {-}

*   **G0/G1 Peak:**
    *   Represents cells in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle
    *   Should be the largest peak in a normal cell cycle distribution
*   **S Phase:**
    *   Represents cells in the S phase of the cell cycle
    *   Appears as a broad shoulder between the G0/G1 and G2/M peaks
*   **G2/M Peak:**
    *   Represents cells in the G2 or M phase of the cell cycle
    *   Should have twice the DNA content of the G0/G1 peak
*   **Sub-G1 Peak:**
    *   Represents cells with fragmented DNA, typically apoptotic cells
    *   Appears to the left of the G0/G1 peak

## **DNA Ploidy Analysis** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Comparing the DNA content of cells in a sample to the DNA content of normal diploid cells
    *   Cells with a DNA content that is different from diploid are considered aneuploid
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Sample Preparation:**
        *   Prepare a sample of normal diploid cells as a control
        *   Fix and stain the control cells and the experimental samples with a DNA-binding dye
    2.  **Flow Cytometry Acquisition:**
        *   Acquire the samples on a flow cytometer
        *   Collect a sufficient number of events to ensure accurate analysis
    3.  **Data Analysis:**
        *   Compare the DNA content of the cells in the experimental samples to the DNA content of the control cells
        *   Identify cells with abnormal DNA content
*   **Example of a good control:**
    *   The use of normal lymphocytes as a diploid control

*   **Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis:**
    *   Identifying tumors with abnormal cell cycle distributions or DNA ploidy
    *   Predicting the aggressiveness of tumors based on their cell cycle characteristics
*   **Drug Discovery:**
    *   Screening for drugs that affect cell cycle progression
    *   Identifying drugs that induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
*   **Toxicology:**
    *   Assessing the toxicity of chemicals on cell proliferation
    *   Identifying chemicals that cause DNA damage or cell cycle arrest

    *   Investigating the role of DNA ploidy in development and disease

## **Cell Cycle Analysis with Additional Markers** {-}

*   **Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs):**
    *   Proteins that regulate cell cycle progression
    *   Can be used to identify cells in specific phases of the cell cycle
*   **Ki-67:**
    *   A nuclear protein that is expressed in proliferating cells
    *   Can be used to identify cells that are actively cycling
*   **Phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3):**
