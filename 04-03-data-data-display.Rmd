## **Overview of Data Display** {-}

*   **Definition:** Data display refers to the various methods used to visualize flow cytometry data, allowing for the identification of cell populations, the assessment of marker expression, and the communication of results
*   **Importance:**
    *   Data Exploration: To explore the data and identify patterns or trends
    *   Data Analysis: To analyze the data and quantify the expression of cell markers
    *   Data Communication: To communicate the results to others
*   **Common Types of Data Displays:**
    *   Dot Plots
    *   Density Plots
    *   Contour Plots
    *   Histograms
    *   Heat Maps
    *   Spectra Plots
*   **Data Transformations:**
    *   Linear
    *   Logarithmic
    *   Biexponential (e.g., Logicle, Hyperlog)

## **Types of Data Displays** {-}

*   **Dot Plots:**
    *   *Description:* Each event (cell) is represented as a single dot on a two-dimensional plot, with the x and y axes representing two different parameters
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize all of the events in the data set
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can be difficult to visualize dense populations of cells
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize cell populations and identify gating boundaries
*   **Density Plots:**
    *   *Description:* Similar to dot plots, but the density of the dots is used to represent the number of events in a given area
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize dense populations of cells more easily than dot plots
    *   *Disadvantages:* May obscure rare events
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize cell populations and identify gating boundaries
*   **Contour Plots:**
    *   *Description:* Similar to density plots, but the data is represented as contour lines that connect points of equal density
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize dense populations of cells and identify subpopulations
    *   *Disadvantages:* May obscure rare events
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize cell populations, identify gating boundaries, and identify subpopulations
*   **Histograms:**
    *   *Description:* A one-dimensional plot that shows the distribution of events for a single parameter
    *   *Advantages:* Can easily visualize the distribution of data for a single parameter
    *   *Disadvantages:* Cannot visualize the relationship between two parameters
    *   *Use Cases:* To assess the expression of a single cell marker and identify positive and negative populations
*   **Heat Maps:**
    *   *Description:* A two-dimensional plot that uses color to represent the value of a parameter
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize the expression of multiple markers across multiple samples
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can be difficult to interpret for large data sets
    *   *Use Cases:* To compare the expression of markers across different samples or cell populations
*   **Spectra Plots:**
    *   *Description:* A plot that shows the emission spectrum of a fluorochrome
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes
    *   *Disadvantages:* Cannot visualize the expression of cell markers
    *   *Use Cases:* To design flow cytometry panels and optimize compensation settings

## **Data Transformations** {-}

*   **Linear Scale:**
    *   *Description:* The data is displayed on a linear scale, with equal intervals representing equal changes in value
    *   *Advantages:* Easy to interpret
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can be difficult to visualize low-intensity signals
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize data with a narrow range of values and to compare the absolute expression levels of cell markers
*   **Logarithmic Scale:**
    *   *Description:* The data is displayed on a logarithmic scale, with equal intervals representing equal fold-changes in value
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize a wide range of values and compress the data. Useful in highlighting multiple populations
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can distort the appearance of the data and make it difficult to compare absolute expression levels
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize data with a wide range of values and to identify populations with low expression levels
*   **Biexponential Scale:**
    *   *Description:* A hybrid scale that combines linear and logarithmic scales
    *   *Advantages:* Can visualize both low-intensity and high-intensity signals
    *   *Disadvantages:* Can be more difficult to interpret than linear or logarithmic scales
    *   *Use Cases:* To visualize data with a wide range of values and to accurately represent both positive and negative populations
*   **Common Biexponential Transformations:**
    *   Logicle Transformation: A biexponential transformation that is commonly used in flow cytometry
    *   Hyperlog Transformation: Another biexponential transformation that is similar to Logicle

## **Choosing the Right Display and Transformation** {-}

*   **Experimental Goals:**
    *   What are you trying to communicate with the data?
    *   Are you trying to identify rare populations, compare expression levels, or visualize cellular relationships?
*   **Data Distribution:**
    *   Is the data normally distributed or skewed?
    *   Does the data have a wide range of values or a narrow range of values?
*   **Audience:**
    *   Who are you presenting the data to?
    *   Are they familiar with flow cytometry data displays and transformations?

## **Practical Guidelines** {-}

*   **Use Dot Plots or Density Plots to Visualize Cell Populations:**
    *   These displays are best for visualizing the overall distribution of cells and identifying gating boundaries
*   **Use Histograms to Assess the Expression of Single Cell Markers:**
    *   Histograms are best for visualizing the distribution of data for a single parameter and identifying positive and negative populations
*   **Use Logarithmic Scales to Visualize a Wide Range of Values:**
    *   Logarithmic scales are best for visualizing data with a wide range of values and for identifying populations with low expression levels
*   **Use Biexponential Scales to Accurately Represent Both Positive and Negative Populations:**
    *   Biexponential scales are best for visualizing data with a wide range of values and for accurately representing both positive and negative populations
*   **Avoid Overplotting:**
    *   If the data set is too large to visualize effectively using dot plots or density plots, consider using contour plots or heat maps

## **Troubleshooting Data Display Issues** {-}

*   **Overlapping Populations:**
    *   *Possible Causes:*
        *   Poor resolution
        *   Incorrect gating

    *   *Troubleshooting Steps:*
        *   Optimize staining protocol

        *   Adjust binning of data
        *   Experiment with different transformation scales
